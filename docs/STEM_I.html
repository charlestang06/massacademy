				<p class="stemwords">This study aims to reduce the number of truck-cyclist
					collisions, which are often caused by semi-trailer trucks making
					right-hook turns and poor driver attention to blind spots. To achieve
					this, we designed a blind spot warning system that can
					detect cyclists. First, several 90%
					accurate object detection models were created using lightweight deep
					learning architectures fine-tuned on a newly proposed cyclist image
					dataset composed of of over 20,000 images. Next, the object
					detection models were deployed onto a Coral Dev Board
					mini-computer with a camera module and analyzed for speed, reaching
					inference times as low as 15 milliseconds. Lastly, the end-to-end
					blind spot detection device was tested in real-time to model traffic
					scenarios. We
					concluded that this device can accurately
					and quickly detect cyclists and have the potential to significantly
					improve cyclist safety. Future studies could determine the
					feasibility of the proposed device in the trucking industry and
					improvements to cyclist collisions over time.</p>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="row flex-nowrap">
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p class="stemwords">Cyclists often face risks when traveling
						along a road or path with other motorized vehicles; in the U.S., over
						1,000 cyclists die in road accidents, and 130,000 more are injured
						yearly (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2022). Over
						71% of cyclist collisions happen in urban areas, with 30% of
						collisions happening at intersections. These cyclist accidents can be
						attributed to a lack of visual attention, including distraction,
						which is a leading cause of over 55% of vehicle-cyclist collisions
						(Jannat et al., 2020). One type of collision that frequently occurs
						between cyclists and vehicles is in a right-hook turn. Right-hook
						collisions occur at intersections when right-turning vehicles collide
						with a cyclist moving straight forwards along the right side of the
						road. These types of collisions occur when drivers do not detect
						cyclists in their oncoming blind spots or when cyclists do not
						observe that a driver is going to take a right turn. Additionally,
						semi-trailer trucks are disproportionately involved in more severe
						cyclist collisions compared to other vehicles (Richter & Sachs,
						2017). When a semi-trailer truck makes a right turn, the blind spot
						from the right rearview mirror increases as the view is blocked by
						the trailer's body. This makes turns especially dangerous because
						VRUs in this blind spot zone cannot be detected and face a high risk
						of collision and fatality (Wang et al., 2022). There exists a need
						for driver assistance systems in order to mitigate risks caused by
						vehicle blind spots and prevent truck-cyclist collisions.</p>

		<h3>Methodology</h3>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="row wrap">
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p class="stemwords">The overall aim of this project was to
						engineer a device that can detect cyclists in a truck’s right-rear
						blind spot and provide alerts for semi-trailer truck drivers. We set
						three major objectives. (1) Develop a system that can actively detect
						cyclists with greater than 80% mAP. (2) Create warnings for cyclists
						in a truck’s right-rear blind spot within a two-second interval. (3)
						Make it portable and installable on most semi-trailer trucks.</p>

					<p class="stemwords">First, a new proposed dataset was created by
						combining the CIMAT cyclist dataset with images available from the
						web and synthetic cyclist images in virtual urban environments from
						Parallel Domain’s Open Synthetic Dataset for Improving Cyclist
						Detection (Thomas et al., 2021). Then, the collected images were
						annotated with bounding boxes using Roboflow API and exported as a
						single-class cyclist Pascal VOC dataset with an 80-20%
						train-validation split (Dwyer & Nelson, 2022; Everingham et al.,
						2012).</p>

					<p class="stemwords">Next, we fine-tuned a cyclist detection model
						using the SSD MobileNet V2 and EfficientDet Lite model architecture
						due to their lightweight memory and CPU/TPU usage and strong
						performance with real-time detection (Sandler et al., 2018; Tan et
						al., 2020). Using the Tensorflow Object Detection API and the
						Tensorflow Lite Model Maker API, the dataset was used to fine-tune an
						SSD MobileNet and EfficientDet Lite model for a total of 50 epochs.</p>

					<p class="stemwords">Then, the trained cyclist detection models
						were deployed onto the Google Coral Dev Board with a camera module.
						The Google Coral Dev Board provides state-of-the-art performance
						concerning object detection inferences in real-time applications
						(Seshadri et al., 2022). Using the Google Coral Dev Board, the frames
						per second (FPS) of each object detection model’s inferences were
						also recorded.</p>

					<p class="stemwords">Finally, we constructed a real-time testing
						environment with a cyclist, a fixed mount for the blind spot device,
						and the blind spot device. The cyclist was guided down a straight
						path to simulate a through-going cyclist. The device was tested
						qualitatively for its effectiveness in detecting cyclists from the
						viewpoint of a truck cab and for inference speed.</p>

		<h3>Analysis</h3>

		<p class="stemwords text-center">Click <a class="hyperlink" href="https://gitlab03.wpi.edu/ctang5/cyclistdetectiondataset" target="0">here to access the cyclist dataset.</a></p>

		<p class="stemwords">Our proposed auxiliary cyclist dataset contains 20,406 cyclist images with over 40,000
			cyclist instances collected from synthetically generated images and collected images from various online
			sources (Thomas et al., 2021). This dataset serves as an extension to the 12,000 cyclist images from the
			CIMAT cyclist dataset and has a greater focus on edge cases, such as night-time, rainy, and busy urban
			environments (Thomas et al., 2021). Initially, 6,802 images were collected, and the images were
			augmented to generate new data points and triple the dataset size. Figure 1 outlines the number of cyclist
			instances per image. There
			was an average of 2.2 cyclist instances per image, meaning that this dataset has high cyclist density and
			was adequate for the cyclist detection task.
		</p>

		<p class="stemwords"> The three single-class cyclist detection models were evaluated using average precision
			(AP) metrics for accuracy. The mAP results are described in Figure 2 and 3. The results show that the
			EfficientDet
			Lite 1 and the EfficientDet Lite 2 are the highest-performing models, with an mAP of 95.6% and 95.4% at the
			IoU threshold of 0.5, respectively, on the newly proposed validation set. The SSD MobileNetV2 model
			performed the weakest at 84.7% mAP (IoU 0.5).
			The mAP was measured to determine the effectiveness of this cyclist detection system.
		</p>

		<p class="stemwords">
			The testing scenario was designed to model a right-hook turn made by a truck near or in front of a
			through-going cyclist. The SSD MobileNetV2 object detection architecture made the
			fastest inference times at 70.6 FPS or 0.0142 seconds of inference time (latency). Figure 4 shows the
			cyclist detection model speeds from real-time testing. Each cyclist detection model performed adequately to
			the objectives set for this project.
