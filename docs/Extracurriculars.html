				<p>At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, my friends and I founded a
				free tutoring program for K-12 students to combat educational
				inequality in our local areas. Iridium Tutoring Ltd. is now a
				501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and has provided over 10,000+ sessions
				of free tutoring to over 300 students. At Iridium, I help organize
				coding for elementary students' events, webinars for college
				applications, algebra courses, and more!</p>

				<p>Nearing the end of 2020, a group of friends and I wanted to support some of the local nonprofits in our community. At Verity Opportunities Ltd., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, I organize local volunteer events such as trail cleanups, food drives, and fundraising competitions to raise funds and awareness for local nonprofits. I enjoy meeting new people of various ages every time I volunteer at a new location, and I love how excited people are to support each other and make the world a better place.
