        STEM II is taught by Dr. Crowthers in the second half of the year, where
        we develop assistive devices in groups. In STEM II, we follow the
        engineering design process in groups, where we design, develop, and test
        a device that can support someone with a disability.

      For the STEM II project, I worked with Joseph Yu, Tarun Eswar, and Nevin

      <h3>Problem Description</h3>

      <p class="stemwords">
        Over 40% of people will experience some form of memory loss by the time
        they turn 60. While memory loss and mental impairments come in many
        forms, one of the most common symptoms is misplacing essential objects
        such as wallets, keys, hearing aids, and glasses. This significantly
        impacts the ability of older adults to live independently. Coupled with
        declining eyesight and physical strength, searching through an entire
        living space for objects can be highly strenuous for older adults and
        can often be unsuccessful. While current widespread solutions in
        production to track and locate missing objects, such as Air Tags and
        Tile Trackers, use Bluetooth transmitters, the resolution of these
        devices is limited to areas often more extensive than the entire house,
        making it unsuitable for isolating a specific area of the house for an
        older adult to search.
      </p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>

      <p class="stemwords">
        Our design will be a rover-based device equipped with computer vision
        technologies that can be a powerful tool for locating misplaced items.
        The device can navigate autonomously through an environment on the
        ground while using its onboard cameras and advanced object recognition
        algorithms to identify and locate specific objects. Once an item has
        been located, the device can alert the user to its location through a
        cloud-based mobile application. This technology has the potential to
        save time and reduce frustration by quickly locating lost or misplaced
        items.
