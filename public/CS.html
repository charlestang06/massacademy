        This yearâ€™s Computer Science course is taught by Mrs. Taricco and
        introduces us to Java, HTML, CSS, web design, and software engineering
        principles. For A term, we developed our own personal websites using
        HTML and CSS. For B term, I was a part of the advanced CS track where we
        developed a project to improve the technology at our school.

      <h3>CHMOD Problem</h3>
      <p>
        In A term, we attempted to solve difficult coding challenges. One of
        these problems was CHMOD, a problem from the American Computer Science
        League (ACSL), where we process Linux commands to change file editing
        permissions. The following is the code solution to the problem. I found
        this problem very enjoyable because it exposed me to a lot of different
        coding strategies.

      <h3>MAMS Digital Sign-In/Out System (SISO)</h3>
      <p>
        In B term,

        <a class="hyperlink" href="https://users.wpi.edu/~dbarsoum" target="0"
          >David Barsoum</a
        >, and I worked on our independent project to improve the sign-in/out
        system at MAMS. The previous sign-in system at Mass Academy was very
        mechanical and time-consuming. We developed this project to improve the
        efficiency and technology related to the sign-in and sign-out methods.
        This digital sign-in/out system uses SQL databases, ReactJS web portal,
        NodeJS backend, and a Raspberry Pi device for interacting with RFID
        tags. The following document is a deliverable that outlines the design
        of the project. Learn more about this project

      <h3>Pantry Access (Apps for Good)</h3>
      <p>
        The final project in the Computer Science course is Apps for Good. We
        are assigned to groups of 3-4 people, where we work together to develop
        an mobile application that can be used to support the lives of people.
        The problem my group focused on was digitzing the process of managing
        food pantries' inventories as well as streamlining the request process
        for clients to get in touch with pantries. To address this issue, my
        group developed a cross-platform web application called Pantry Access
        which is a universal food pantry application for both clients and pantry
        organizers. Learn more about this project

              <b>Problem Statement</b>: Food pantries often have trouble
              maintaining their inventories and organizing their food supply to
              deliver items to clients effectively. Furthermore, with a growing
              demand in food banks, there is a pressing need for software that
              can connect food pantries and clients.
            </p>
            <p class="stemwords">
              <b>Target Audience</b>: The target audience of the proposed
              application are food bank volunteers, food bank management, and
              potential clients and donors.
            </p>
            <p class="stemwords">
              <b>Solution</b>: We built a cross-platform cloud-based application
              that improves the organization of food pantries and communication
              between clients and food banks.
            </p>
            <p class="stemwords">
              <b>Minimal Viable Product (MVP)</b> The three core features of
              this application are (in order of precedence): (1) Collect and
              manage the inventory of food banks into a database that tracks
              current inventory, quantities, and locations of the foods; (2)
              allow clients to access and view the inventories of food banks
              through a user-friendly interface; (3) create unique profiles for
              clients, food banks, or donors to foster stronger client-food-bank
              or donor-food-bank relations.
            </p>
            <p class="stemwords">
              <b>Features and Algorithms</b>: To allow this application to be
              cross-platform, we utilized Firebase's Firestore and hosting cloud
              services. Our sorting algorithms for managing food pantry
              inventories are provided with the Material-UI (MUI) Component
              Library.
