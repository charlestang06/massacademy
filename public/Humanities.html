			<p>Instead of the traditional history and English classes taken at my
			sending school, Mass Academy offers a humanities course taught by Ms.
			Small that combines aspects of traditional English classes, history,
			sociology, psychology, and anthropology. Over the course of the year,
			we discuss the question "What does it mean to be human?" through a
			variety of perspectives. For A term, we discussed Walden, by Henry
			David Thoreau, and education in America. In B term, we learned about
			satires and wrote our own satirical analysis.</p>

		<h3>Education Synthesis Essay</h3>
		<p>In A term, we discussed the impacting factors of education and how
			we can improve it. As a final assignment for this topic, we wrote an
			essay about education. I chose to write about inclusivelness, mental
			health, and communities within an educational community.</p>

		<h3>Satirical Analysis Essay</h3>
		<p>In B term, we discussed the key elements of satires and analyzed
			satires for their effectiveness. For the final assignment of this
			module, I compare and contrasted two satires on their tone and
			delivery. The first satire, <i>A Modest Proposal</i>, by Jonathan
			Swift, satirizes eating babies to solve the problem of poverty in the
			1700s. The second satire, <i>Babycakes</i>, by Neil Gaiman, satirizes
			eating babies to highlight the issue of waste and environmental
			damage.
